### Description 

- This experiment investigates weather the use of Google Trends search index data helps in making better sales foreacsts. 
- The experiment is applied on two real-world datasets: (1) [Brazilian e-commerce by Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) and (2) [Breakfast at the Frat by dunnhumby](https://www.dunnhumby.com/source-files/). 
- [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/?geo=TR) data used in this experiment is collected from the official website.
- The null hypothesis is that combining Google Trends data with real-world data will help make better sales forecasts. Results are analysed and a paired t-test is conducted to test the null hypothesis. 
- The source code  of the experiment is made available to the public and can be adapted in future projects. 

### Prediction Task  

The prediction task for the Brazilian e-commerce dataset is to forecast the weekly number of sales transactions by product category. The scope of sales transactions from the Brazilian e-commerce dataset are limited to the Sao Paolo region and for the top 7 selling product categories. Hence, for the Brazilian e-commerce dataset, each forecasting model (SARIMA, FBProphet, XGBoost, LSTM) is run 7 times, once for each product category. 

The prediction task for Breakfast at the Frat dataset is to forecast the weekly number of units sold of 4 items across 3 stores. Therefore, using the Breakfast at the Frat dataset, each forecasting model (SARIMA, FBProphet, XGBoost, LSTM) is run 12 times, once for each product and store combination. The data used from the Breakfast at the Frat dataset include sales history, promotional, product, manufacturer and store information.

### Configuration files

##### catalog.yml

Here are a few examples of paths that are used to reference the datasets. There are two major branches, olist and breakfast.

```yaml
olist:
    base_dir: "data/01_raw"
    tables:
        customers:     "olist_customers_dataset.csv"
        products:
    ...
    ...

breakfast:
    base_dir: "data/01_raw"
    xlsx_fname: "dunnhumby_breakfast.xlsx"
    sheet_names: 
        transactions: "dh Transaction Data"
    ...
    ...
```

##### params.yml

The experiment dates defined in this configuration file.   

```yaml
olist:
    experiment_dates: 
        train_start: '2017-01-01'
        test_start: '2018-01-07'
    ...
    ...

breakfast:
    dataset:
        store_ids: 
            2277: 'OH'       
            2277: 'OH'       
            389: 'KY'         
            25229: 'TX' 
        upc_ids:
            1600027527: 'cold_cereal'
            3800031838: 'cold_cereal'
    ...
    ...
```

##### model parameters

For the XGBoost model, there are a few parameters that need to be specified:

- `window_size` is used to create the number of lagged values as input for the model. A value of 52 will create 52 lags of the target column. 
- `avg_units` is used to create rolling averages using the lag-1 column to avoid leakage. It represents a list of rolling average features. A value of 2 will create a two time steps rolling-average, while a value of 16 will create a rolling-average of 16 time steps. Each will represent a column in the dataset.
- `gtrends_window_size` is used to cerate the number of lagged values for the google trends series. Each google trend series will be created usign this value.
- `search_iter` is used to specify how many rounds of hyperparameter search to perform using Hyperopt.

For the LSTM model, there are different parameters that need to be specified:

- `window_size` is used to create the number of lagged values as input for the model. A value of 52 will create 52 lags of the target column. 
- `gtrends_window_size` is used to cerate the number of lagged values for the google trends series. This value must be the same as the window_size as the LSTM expects the same number of dimensions for each feature.
- `dropout` is a hyperparameter that is specified in advance. It is used to reduce overfitting but could be included in the hyperparameter search if desired.
- `units_strategy` is used to determine how to select the number of hidden units for each LSTM layer. A stable strategy will keep the number of units constant accross layers. A decrease strategy will halve the number of units per layer. For a three layer model with initial number of units set to 50, the stable strategy will assign 50 units for each layer while the decrease strategy will set 50 for the first layer, 25 for the second layer and 16 for the third layer.
- `optimizers` the optimizer to use. 
- `loss` the loss to use.
- `search_iter` the number of random search iterations to perform during hyperparameter tunning.

Here is an example.  

```yaml
xgb:
    window_size: 52
    avg_units:
        - 2
        - 4
        - 8
        - 16
        - 26
    gtrends_window_size: 12
    search_iter: 100

lstm:
    window_size: 52
    gtrends_window_size: 52    # <- must match window_size
    dropout: 0.1
    units_strategy: 'decrease' # <- options are {decrease, stable}
    optimizers: 'adam'
    loss: 'mape'
    search_iter: 20
```
